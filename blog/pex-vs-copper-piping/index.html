        <p>When it comes to residential plumbing, the two dominant pipe materials are PEX and copper. Both are excellent materials with distinct advantages and trade-offs. Yucaipa Plumbing Co uses both PEX and copper throughout Yucaipa, CA and can help you decide which is right for your project. Let us break down the differences.</p>
<h2>Understanding PEX</h2>
<p>PEX stands for cross-linked polyethylene. It is a flexible plastic tubing that has become the dominant choice for residential water supply lines over the past two decades. PEX was developed in Europe in the 1960s and has been widely used in the United States since the 1990s. It is now used in the majority of new residential construction and has largely replaced copper for interior water supply lines.</p>
<p>PEX comes in three types: PEX-A, PEX-B, and PEX-C, which differ in their manufacturing process. PEX-A (Engel method) is the most flexible and has the best expansion memory, meaning it can be stretched and will return to its original shape. PEX-B (silane method) is slightly stiffer but still very flexible and is the most commonly used type. PEX-C (radiation method) is the stiffest of the three. All three types are suitable for residential plumbing and meet the same performance standards.</p>
<p>PEX is available in multiple sizes, with half-inch and three-quarter-inch being the most common for residential use. It comes in long rolls (up to 1,000 feet) and can be run in continuous lengths from a manifold to each fixture, minimizing connections and potential leak points. Color-coded red and blue PEX makes it easy to identify hot and cold lines.</p>
<h2>Understanding Copper</h2>
<p>Copper has been the gold standard for residential plumbing for over 70 years. It is a rigid metal pipe that comes in three wall thicknesses: Type M (thinnest, most common for residential), Type L (medium, used for exposed locations and some codes), and Type K (thickest, used for underground and water mains). Copper pipes are joined using solder (sweat) fittings, compression fittings, or push-fit connectors.</p>
<p>Copper is valued for its proven longevity, with a typical lifespan of 50 to 70 years or more. It has natural antimicrobial properties that inhibit bacterial growth on the pipe surface. Copper is also fully recyclable, making it an environmentally responsible choice. Many homes built in the 1950s through 1990s have copper plumbing that is still functioning well today.</p>
<p>Copper pipes come in 10-foot and 20-foot straight lengths, requiring fittings at every turn and connection point. Each fitting is a potential leak point if not properly soldered, and the rigid nature of the pipe means that installation requires more skill and time than PEX.</p>

<h2>Cost Comparison</h2>
<p>PEX is significantly less expensive than copper in both material and installation costs. PEX tubing costs roughly one-third to one-half the price of copper pipe per linear foot. But the bigger savings come from installation. PEX is faster to install because it is flexible (fewer fittings needed), can be run in long continuous lengths, does not require soldering (connections use crimp rings, clamp rings, or push-fit fittings), and is lighter and easier to handle.</p>
<p>The labor savings from faster PEX installation can reduce the total plumbing cost of a new home or repipe by 30 to 50 percent compared to copper. For a whole-house repipe, PEX typically costs $4,000 to $8,000 installed, while copper runs $8,000 to $15,000 or more depending on the home size and complexity.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that copper has significant scrap value, which can offset some of the cost if you are replacing existing copper pipes. PEX has no scrap value. However, the upfront savings from PEX usually far outweigh the scrap value of old copper.</p>
<h2>How They Perform in Real Conditions</h2>
<p>PEX excels in freeze resistance. Its flexibility allows it to expand when water freezes inside, making it far less likely to burst than rigid copper. This is a significant advantage in climates where freezing is a concern. PEX is also quieter than copper, as it does not transmit water hammer and flow noise the way rigid metal pipes do.</p>
<p>PEX is resistant to scale buildup and corrosion. Unlike copper, which can develop pinhole leaks from aggressive water chemistry, PEX is immune to electrochemical corrosion. It does not react with acidic or alkaline water and does not develop the green patina (verdigris) that copper does. In areas with aggressive water that causes copper pipe failures, PEX is often the recommended alternative.</p>
<p>Copper has its own performance advantages. It is unaffected by UV light (PEX degrades with sun exposure and cannot be used outdoors or in areas with direct sunlight), can handle higher temperatures and pressures than PEX, and has a longer track record of proven performance. Copper's rigidity also means it does not sag or flex like PEX, providing a cleaner, more professional appearance in exposed installations.</p>

<h2>Health and Safety Considerations</h2>
<p>Both PEX and copper are approved for potable water use by all major building codes and health authorities. Copper has the advantage of natural antimicrobial properties, meaning bacteria do not thrive on copper surfaces the way they can on plastic. Some studies have shown that copper plumbing systems have lower levels of biofilm formation than plastic systems.</p>
<p>Early PEX products had issues with chemicals leaching into the water, affecting taste and odor. Modern PEX manufacturing has largely addressed these concerns, and current PEX products meet stringent standards for chemical leaching. However, some homeowners report a slight plastic taste in water from new PEX installations, which typically dissipates within a few weeks of use.</p>
<p>Copper can leach copper into the water, especially in new installations or in homes with acidic water. While small amounts of copper are safe and even essential for human health, excessive copper can cause gastrointestinal problems and stain fixtures with a blue-green tint. Homes with low-pH water may need a neutralizer to protect copper pipes and prevent excessive copper dissolution.</p>
<h2>Making the Right Choice for Your Home</h2>
<p>Choose PEX if budget is a primary concern, you want faster installation with less disruption, your home is in an area prone to freezing, your water chemistry is aggressive to copper, or you are doing a whole-house repipe and want to minimize cost and time. Choose copper if you prefer a material with a longer proven track record, aesthetics matter and pipes will be exposed, your local building code requires it for certain applications, or you value the antimicrobial properties of copper.</p>
<p>Many plumbers use a combination of both materials, using copper for exposed runs in utility areas and main supply lines and PEX for distribution to individual fixtures. This hybrid approach leverages the strengths of both materials.</p>
